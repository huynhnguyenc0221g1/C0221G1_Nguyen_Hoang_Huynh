<p class="paragraph"><span class="initial-letter">S</span>o I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with
    my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a
    mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or
    death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.
    The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated
    than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when
    I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:</p>
<p class="quote">"If you please−− draw me a sheep!"</p>
<p class="quote">"What!"</p>
<p class="quote">"Draw me a sheep!"</p>
<p class="paragraph">I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all
    around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here
    you may see the best potrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less
    charming than its model.</p>
