<p class="paragraph"><span class="initial-letter">O</span>nce when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a
    book, called True Stories from
    Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is
    a copy of the drawing.</p>
<p class="paragraph">In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that
    they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."</p>
<p class="paragraph">I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored
    pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:</p>

<p class="paragraph">I showed my masterpiece to the grown−ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.</p>
<p class="paragraph">But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"</p>
<p class="paragraph">My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant.
    But since the grown−ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa
    constrictor, so that the grown−ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing
    Number Two looked like this:</p>
